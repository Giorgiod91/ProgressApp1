## Overview

This app allows users to track their habits, create new tasks, and mark them as complete. It is designed to help users stay motivated and organized.

You can check it out live [here](https://progress-app1.vercel.app/).

### Demo Version
For demonstration purposes, the demo version allows you to create and manage tasks locally without needing to log in. This is to simplify the review process for recruiters and others who want to quickly see the app in action without the need for authentication.

## Tech Stack

This project is built with a modern web development stack, including:

- **TypeScript**: For type-safe JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For fast and flexible styling.
- **Prisma**: As an ORM for database management.
- **Supabase**: For backend services and database hosting.
- **tRPC**: For end-to-end type-safe APIs.
- **Next-Auth**: for secure and easy user management.

## Key Learnings

During the development of this app, I gained valuable insights into:

- **tRPC**: Understanding the full capabilities of tRPC for creating type-safe API routes.
- **Prisma**: Deepening my knowledge of Prisma ORM for database interactions.
